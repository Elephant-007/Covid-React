Files Organization
------------------

Files are organized in a specific manner to differentiate between version specific files and common files.  The mechanism is transparent to the user of the asdl module (in this directory).

Version specific files are placed under "py$major_$minor", where $major and $minor represents the major and minor version tuple of Python; for example, "py2_7" is for Python2.7.

Common files are placed inside the "common" directory


File Lookup Order
-----------------

Version-specific files are searched first.  If they don't exist, the common ones are used.


Usage
-----

	import schema
	sch = schema.load("Python.asdl")
	sch.verify(some_ast)

Testing
-------

Run tests in the current directory:

$ python -m unittest discover -vft tests
