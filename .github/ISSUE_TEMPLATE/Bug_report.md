Thanks for opening an issue! To help the Numba team handle your information
efficiently, please first ensure that there is no other issue present that
already describes the issue you have
(search at https://github.com/numba/numba/issues?&q=is%3Aissue).

-->

<!--

Please include details of the bug here, including, if applicable, what you
expected to happen!

## Summary
<!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. -->

## Environment

## Minimal Example
<!-- If possible, please create a minimal example here that exhibits the problematic behavior.
You can also link to [godbolt](https://godbolt.org). But please note that you need to set the godbolt language to Python which is default c++ and click the "Share" button in the top right-hand corner of the godbolt page where you reproduce the sample code to get the share link instead of in your browser address bar.

You can read [the guidelines on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
on how to create a good minimal example. -->
