Numba IR Stages
===============

To allow Numba as a general purpose compiler, we provide different entry
points. These entry points also allow for further decoupling of the Numba
architecture. We propose several new Intermediate Representations (IRs),
from high-level to low-level:

    * The Python AST IR (input to a numba frontend)
    * Initial Python-like IR
    * Untyped IR in SSA form
    * Typed IR in SSA form
    * Low-level IR in SSA form
    * Final LLVM IR, the final input for LLVM. This IR is unportable
      since the sizes of types are fixed.

All IRs except the last are portable across machine architectures.

Intermediate Representations
============================

Each IR consists of two layers, namely a higher-level Abstract Syntax Tree
encoding, specified, verified and generated by our variant of ASDL
schemas. We add the symbol ``@`` to signal that the given type
is to be treated as a "unique" object, i.e. one that compares by identity
as opposed to structural equality. These objects each carry a unique id
and are serialized in a table (and they may participate in circular
references, i.e. in a graph):

Serialization to LLVM IR (or a direct textual serialization) will
consist of something like a generated table, e.g.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> mod = schema.parse("foo = @Foo(str name, foo attr)")

    >>> foo1 = mod.Foo("foo1")
    >>> foo2 = mod.Foo("foo2", foo1)
    >>> foo1.attr = foo2

    >>> foo1
    Foo(name="foo1", attr=Foo("foo2", Foo(name="foo1", attr=...)))

    >>> build_llvm_ir(foo1)   # name,  id,    attr
    !0 = metadata !{ metadata !"foo1", i64 0, i64 1 }
    !1 = metadata !{ metadata !"foo2", i64 1, i64 0 }

Attributes may also be hidden using ``\``, which means the attribute
is not considered a child for the purposes of visitors or term
rewrites::

    foo = @Foo(str name, foo \attr)

Use of Schemas
--------------
We can use our schemas to:

    * Validate IR instances
    * Generate Python AST classes with typed properties and fast
      visitor dispatching
    * Generate Higher- or Lower-level LLVM IR
    * Generate conversion code to and from an ATerm representation
    * Generate a flat representation. E.g. a form of Three Address Code
    * Generate an implementation in other languages that can load a
      serialized representation and construct an AST in that langauge
    * Generate type definitions and serialization routines in
      other languages.

        .. NOTE:: This can help other languages target Numba as
                  a backend compiler more easily, since they can
                  build up the IR using in-memory data structures for
                  the IR most suitable to their needs.

    * Generate definitions for use in Attribute Grammars ()
    * Executable IR (:ref:`executable`)

.. _llvm_ir:

LLVM IR
^^^^^^^

We can generate automatic mapping code to map schema instances to
opaguely typed LLVM IR automatically, which is the abstract syntax
generated post-order. E.g. ``a + b * c`` becomes:

.. code-block:: llvm

    !0 = metadata !{ metadata !"operator", i8* "Mul" }
    !1 = metadata !{ metadata !"operator", i8* "Add" }

    define i8* some_func(i8* %a, i8* %b, i8* %c) {
    entry:
      %0 = call i8* @numba.ir.BinOp(%b, metadata !{0}, %c)
      %1 = call i8* @numba.ir.BinOp(%a, metadata !{1}, %0)
      ret %1
    }

The LLVM IR contains the high-level block structure, i.e. an ``if`` statement
will generate IR along the following lines:

.. code-block:: llvm

    define i8* @func() {
    entry:
        %0 = blockaddress(@func, %bb_test)
        %1 = blockaddress(@func, %bb_true)
        %2 = blockaddress(@func, %bb_false)
        %3 = i8*  @If(i8* %0, i8* %1, i8* %2)

      bb_test:
        ...

      bb_true:
        ...

      bb_false:
        ...
    }

An LLVM IR instance can be mapped back losslessly to an IR instance of a
different representation (e.g. a DAG).

We can use a well-defined abstraction that can map these higher-level
constructs to the lower-level equilvent. This can be used
simultenously by:

    * The control flow graph builder
    * Any IR that wants control flow expanded
    * The code generator

We can use this
construct to expand our IR to IR that corresponds more closely to
the final IR we would generate, where all control flow is expanded
to branches::

    define i8* @func() {
    entry:
        br label %bb_test

      bb_test:
        %test = ...
        br i1 %test, label %bb_true, label %bb_false

      bb_true:
        ...
        br label %bb_false

      bb_false:
        ...
        br label %bb_exit

      bb_exit:
        ...

    }

Passes can do not care about special control structures can then execute
on this IR.

.. _executable:

Executable IR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ideas:

    * Implement a library to which the generated abstract
      LLVM IR can link. E.g. implement functions such as
      ``@BinOp(%add, %lhs, %rhs)`` (we can call this function
      ``PyNumber_Add``).

If we define new lowered IRs are a specialized subset of higher-level
IRs, we get execution for free:

   * Generate conversion code to and from a high-level Python AST
     or source code.

     For instance, ``PointerIndex(base_type, node, index)`` becomes
     ``Call(func=Name('base_type'), args=[Subscript(subnode, index)])``.
     This function can then be compiled and interpreted with Python,
     using abstract argument inputs.

Alternatively, if we already know which operations our data corresponds
to, we can generate a simple AST or bytecode evaluator.

.. _cfg:

Control Flow
------------
We can have a single abstraction that can create basic blocks and
link blocks together. For instance we for the following structure::

    For(expr target, expr iter, stmt* body, stmt* orelse)

We have the following CFG:

.. digraph:: cfg

    entry -> condition -> body -> condition -> orelse -> exit

In this CFG, ``break`` and ``continue`` correspond to the following edges:

.. digraph:: break

    break -> exit
    continue -> condition

We can use this single abstraction to:

   * Create a CFG at any time in any IR stage. For instance we can
     generate LLVM IR automatically with expanded control flow.

     .. NOTE:: This also includes the code generator, which doesn't
               hconditionave to handle any block structures.

   * Retain high-level information that allows for simple
     classification and accurate error reporting.

     .. NOTE:: This is important to allow us to easily rewrite entire
               control flow structures, such as outlining of the prange
               construct.

Initial Python-like IR
----------------------

The initial, Python-like, IR is a subset of a Python AST, the
syntax exludes:

    * ``FunctionDef`` and ``ClassDef``, which are normalized
      to ``Assign`` of the function and subsequent
      decorator applications and assignments
    * No list, dict, set or generators comprehensions, which are
      normalized to ``For(...)`` etc + method calls

The initial IR is what numba decorators produce given a pure
Python AST, function or class as input.


Sample schema

.. code-block:: ocaml

    module initial {

        mod = NumbaModule(unit* stats)

        unit
          = lambda
          | class

        -- functions --
        lambda
          = Lambda(posinfo pos, funcmeta meta, str name, arguments args,
                   expr body)

        funcmeta
          = FunctionMetaData(
                -- locals={'foo': double}
                str* names,     -- 'foo'
                nbtype* types,  -- double
                bool nopython,
            )

        -- classes --
        class
          = ClassExpr(posinfo pos, bool is_jit, attrtable table, method* methods)

        attrtable
          = AttributeTable(str* attrnames, nbtype* attrtypes)

        method
          = Method(posinfo pos, methodsignature signature, stat* body)

        -- Types --

        type = nbtype
        nbtype
          = char | short | int_ | long_ | longlong
          | uchar | ushort | uint | ulong | ulonglong
          | ...
          | functype
          | methodtype

        methodtype
          = MethodSignature(functype signature,
                            bool is_staticmethod,
                            bool is_classmethod,
                            bool is_jit, -- whether this is a jit or
                                         -- autojit method
                           )
    }

.. NOTE:: Numba would construct this before starting any pipeline stage.

Untyped IR in SSA form
----------------------

Untyped IR in SSA form would be constructed internally by numba during
and after the CFA pass and before type inference. This adds to the
``initial`` schema control flow information such as::

    * SSA
    * Stack variable stack allocation (non-ssa variables)
    * Def-use and use-def chains

The high-level CFG at this stage is gone, and we
have an untyped IR in SSA form (that is, it contains PhiNode AST nodes with uses
from variables of incoming blocks). It also has a reference to all live phis
in preorder according to the dominator tree in the ``FunctionDef``.

Furthermore:

    * ``ast.Name`` is rewritten to ``NameTarget``, ``NameReference`` or ``NameParam``
    * ``If``, ``While`` and ``For`` lose the ``else`` clause
    * In-place assignments are normalized

::

    module untyped {

        function
          = FunctionDef(phi \all_phis, ...)

        phi
          = Phi(use* \incoming)

        def
          = NameTarget(posinfo pos, str id, use* \uses)
          | phi

        use
          = NameReference(posinfo pos, str id, nbtype type, def \def)
          | PhiRef(phi \def)

        lambda
          = Lambda(posinfo pos, funcmeta meta, str name, arguments args,
                   expr body, cfg cfg)

        stmt
          = For(expr target,
                expr iter,
                stmt* body)
          | ...

    }

Typed IR in SSA form
--------------------

The typed IR is similar to the untyped IR, except that every (sub-)expression
is annotated with a type.

Furthermore, the AST is augmented with
``Promotion`` terms, which promote a variable for a merge in a subsequent
CFG block. E.g.::

    # y_0
    if x > 10:
        # block_if
        y = 2           # y_1
    else:
        # block_else
        y = 3.0         # y_2

In the example above, ``block_if`` will contain a ``Promotion`` with a use
of ``y_1``, replacing all uses of ``y_1`` with the promotion value (which
can only ever be a single phi node).

I.e. we rewrite ``y_1 = 2`` to ``[ y_1 = 2 ; %0 = Promote(y_1, float) ]`` and
``PhiNode(NameRef(y_1), NameRef(y_2))`` to ``PhiNode(%0, NameRef(y_2))``.

All types adhere themselves to a schema, e.g.::

    type
      = Array(type dtype, int ndim)
      | Pointer(type base_type, int? size)
      | ...

Since the schema specifies the interfaces of the different nodes, users
can supply their own node implementation (something we can do with the
type system). Hence user-written classes can be automatically
instantiated instead of generated ones. The code generator can still
emit code for serialization.

Low-level Portable IR
=====================

The low-level portable IR is a low-level, platform agnostic, IR that:

    * The IR contains only low-level, native types such as ``int_``,
      ``long_``, pointers, structs, etc. The notion of high-level
      concepts such as arrays or objects is gone.
