# Features

NumPy Arrays

```python

    # Type inference for NumPy code
    np.zeros((M, N), dtype=np.float32)

```

Python code:

    * Closures
    * Extension types
    * List comprehensions
    * etc

Inferfacing with C:

    * Structs/pointers
    * Supports ctypes
        * Future: support CFFI, C++

Dynamic:

    * Just-in-time specialization
        * Dynamic extension types
        * Dynamic callbacks
        * etc
