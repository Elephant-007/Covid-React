Numba Documentation
===================

The numba documentation is split over two repositories:

    The user and developer documentation:

        https://github.com/numba/numba (the 'docs' directory)

    The webpage, numba.pydata.org:

        https://github.com/numba/numba-webpage

User and Developer Documentation
================================
The documentation is under the 'docs' directory of the numba repo (this directory).

To build the documentation, you need the basicstrap theme and sphinxjp.themecore:

    $ pip install sphinxjp.themes.basicstrap
    $ pip install sphinxjp.themecore

You can edit the source files under docs/source/, after which you can build and
check the documentation:

    $ make html
    $ open _build/html/index.html

This documentation can be uploaded to http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/index.html
using the gh-pages.py script under docs/:

    $ python gh-pages.py version # version can be 'dev' or '0.8' etc

then verify the repository under the 'gh-pages' directory and use 'git push'.

Webpage
=======
The numba webpage on numba.pydata.org can be fetched from here: https://github.com/numba/numba-webpage

After pushing documentation to a new version, you will want to update the website. Some notable files:

    index.rst       # Update main page
    _templates/sidebar_versions.html    # Update sidebar links
    doc.rst         # Update after adding a new version for numba docs
    download.rst    # Updata after uploading new numba version to pypi

After updating run:

    $ make html

and check out _build/html/index.html. To push to numba.pydata.org:

    $ python _scripts/gh-pages.py

then verify the repository under the 'gh-pages' directory.
Make sure the CNAME file is present and contains a single line 'numba.pydata.org'.
Finally, use 'git push' to update the website.
